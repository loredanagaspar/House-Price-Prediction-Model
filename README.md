# House-Price-Prediction-Model
Identification and optimisation of the best regression model for house price prediction.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning Regression techniques** to predict **house prices** based on features such as:
- **Size (sq. ft.)**
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Number of Bathrooms**
- **Location (City Centre, Suburbs, Rural Area)**

I compared different regression models to find the most accurate price prediction.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data processing & visualization
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine Learning models

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis. |
| `house_price.dataset.CSV` | Dataset used for training and testing the model. |


## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Size is the most important predictor** of house prices.
- **Random Forest Regression performed best** with 99% accuracy.
- **Fine-tuning hyperparameters** improved model performance.
